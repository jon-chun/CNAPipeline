    "\n",
    "In this experiment we use sentiment analysis provided by TextBlob and topic modelling. The following libraries are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NLTK\n",
    "- TextBlob\n",
    "- Gensim\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, these general purpose technologies are tested against state-of-the-art equivalents\n",
    "\n",
    "- Watson API \n",
    "\n",

    "Sentiment analysis is a technique used to understand the sentiment of a body of text through either scoring of words or classification relative to a reference dataset. TextBlob uses a sentiment analysis algorithm provided by the Computational and Psycholinguistics Research Centre (CLiPS). The method is based on crowdsourcing scores of individual words from which sentiment is derived by averaging word scores in a string. The result is a numerical value between -1.0 to indicate negativity and +1.0 to indicate positivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Modelling is a statistical method used to reveal latent themes in a text by grouping terms together in a single topic. For example, the terms, 'patient', 'doctor', 'disease', 'cancer', ad 'health' will represents topic 'healthcare'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, these techniques are applied to Hitler's manifesto, Mein Kampf, as a way to test each of these technologies.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Discussion of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "For overall sentiment, Mein Kampf scores consistently higher than I Have a Dream for TextBlob. From these results, there are two statements of particular interest from \\emph{Mein Kampf}.\n",
    "\n",
    "``A state which in this age of racial poisoning dedicates itself to the care of its best racial elements must some day become lord of the earth``\n",
    "\n",
    "That this statement yields a positive score of +1, for which there is no higher sentiment, is a somewhat troubling result. Reading this statement in context, Hitler others immigrants by equating immigration to racial poisoning whereby \"All great cultures of the past perished only because the originally creative race died out from blood poisoning\". He is, therefore, arguing to preserve a state's \"racial purity\" by tending to its indigenous people he regards as a state's \"best racial elements\". In other words, he creates a self-other gradient between each by dehumanising immigrants as an in-pure outgroup while elevating the purity of those he presents as his indigenous people - the ingroup audience for whom he writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement should be seen, therefore, as the essential premise of racism by inciting violence or hate against immigrants, which in this case ultimately led to genocide.\n",
    "\n",
    "``Like a swarm of hornets they tackled disturbers at our meetings, regardless of superiority of numbers, however great, indifferent to wounds and bloodshed, inspired with the great idea of blazing a trail for the sacred mission of our movement``\n",
    "\n",
    "The second of these statements refers to \"defensive squads\" of men tasked with maintaining order at Nationalist Socialist meetings. Reading this statement in context, Hitler legitimises the violent way in which they maintained order by praising their violent actions, yet yields a score of +0.8. How these numerical values relates to the specific features of hate speech is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the results for topic modelling seem to have meaning for each particular text, whether or not each constitute hatefulness is indeterminable. The Gensim results are inconclusive since there does not appear to be definitive terms to detect topics related to hate speech."
